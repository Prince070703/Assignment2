Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a for Loop
This Python script calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.
ðŸ“„ Code Description:
Initializes a variable total to store the sum.
Uses a for loop with range(1, 51) to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive).
In each iteration, the current number i is added to total.
After the loop ends, the final sum is printed.

âœ… Output:
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
